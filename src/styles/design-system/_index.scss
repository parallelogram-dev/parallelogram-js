/* Design System - Main Entry Point */
/* Import this file to access all design tokens, mixins, and component patterns */

/* Forward all tokens so they're available when using @use */
@forward 'tokens';

/* Forward all mixins */
@forward 'mixins';

/* Forward component patterns */
@forward 'components';

/* Forward legacy variables for backwards compatibility */
@forward 'variables';

/* Usage in components:
 * @use '../../design-system' as ds;
 *
 * Then access tokens:
 *   padding: ds.$space-md;
 *   color: ds.$primary;
 *
 * Use mixins:
 *   @include ds.transition(opacity);
 *   @include ds.focus-visible;
 *
 * Use component patterns:
 *   @include ds.form-control;
 *   @include ds.button-primary;
 *   @include ds.panel-base;
 *
 * Legacy components can still use:
 * @use '../../design-system/variables' as *;
